# Macro-Pad-Hack-Club
This is my first time creating a macropad and also the first doing something like PCB, Coding, And design (it hurted like hell)


# Features 
it shows you the flags in asseto corsa competitione (ACC) using leds and the OLED display
it also can be used as a normal macropad


# Components 
9x SK6812 MINI-E LEDs
1x 0.91 inch OLED displays
12x MX-Style switches
12x Through-hole 1N4148 Diodes


# PCB 
Here is the picture of the PCB and the schemathics (i use 9 leds for showing flags from ACC)
